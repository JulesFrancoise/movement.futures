This workshop brings us together as a research partnership that reconsiders, expands upon and reconstitutes the [movingstories research partnership](http://www.movingstories.ca) to consider future research that can have an impact on what it is to be human, and is a preparation for a SSHRC international partnership LOI (letter of intent) that will be submitted on February 15th 2017.

Over the last 4 years, movingstories has developed a thriving and promising community of researchers coming together to explore digital tools for movement, meaning and interaction. You are invited to expand upon our research as part of our movement.futures.
It is time to look to the future and to consider how we want to work together toward that future. We are bringing together experts in movement analysis, dance research, design, psychophysics, robotics, neuroscience, cognition, sound research, psychology, computer science and artificial intelligence, visualization, personal data and the quantified | qualified self, artistic practice, humanities, philosophy and media theory. We argue that multiple perspectives are critical to revealing, articulating, exploring and solving the meaningful research that can transform our current world into a future in which knowledge, awareness and practice create new opportunities for rich connection and quality of life. Letâ€™s look toward the future-possible.
